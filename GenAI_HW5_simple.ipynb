        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "Through this assignment, I gained a deep, hands-on understanding of how multi-agent systems can coordinate through structured message passing and how MCP (Model Context Protocol) enables clean separation between AI reasoning and external tool execution. Implementing a Router Agent, Customer Data Agent, and Support Agent forced me to think about agency specialization, intent routing, and how to design protocols for agent-to-agent communication. I also learned how important it is to build explicit logging for transparency—once the system became more complex, multi-step workflows (such as querying a customer, creating a ticket, and generating a final answer) were only understandable because each agent logged when and why control was handed off. Integrating Gemini as the underlying LLM required designing prompts for deterministic behaviors, extracting structured signals, and building a consistent state flow across the agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most challenging part was handling multi-step coordination. Scenarios such as billing escalation or “active customers with open tickets” required the Router Agent to break the request into subtasks, negotiate information between agents, and merge partial results into a coherent final message. MCP integration also introduced difficulties: JSON-RPC streaming, argument schemas, error propagation, and SQLite bindings required debugging and enforcing strict input/output formats. Additionally, running the MCP server inside Colab created concurrency issues (like port conflicts and lingering background threads). Working through these challenges helped me understand the practical engineering considerations behind AI-driven orchestration—especially the importance of tool design, deterministic routing logic, and robust agent collaboration patterns"
